		<h1>Coffee Drinker Change Log</h1>
		<h3>Version 0.8.3</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Added scientific notation for numbers greater than 100000 or less than .001</li>
			<li>Changed some Worker balancing, primarily million mouth monster is not as strong initially</li>
			<li>Caffeine siphon tweaked to be not quite so powerful</li>
			<li>Changed the font to Lato</li>
			<li>Added a link to this page in the console that links to this page on loading a saved game</li>
			<li>Changed some variable names internally (this is why saves were deleted)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Moving forward, I will provide a changelog here, as well as create a beta branch. I will link to the beta version from this page when it is up.
		Hopefully, having a separate beta version will be a fair compromise for users looking to see what I'm currently working on, 
		while allowing others to not have their saves deleted (as often at least, there is much that is still subject to change).
		<p>
